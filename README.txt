\f0\fs24 \cf0 - What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?\
\
Overall, this assignment took me 5 hours-ish to finish. The most challenging piece for me was to ensure that the images and links were functioning correctly, \
especially when re-organizing the file and folder structure. And I think working with HTML and CSS might be considered both easy and challenging - easy because\
of its simple syntax, and beginners like me could quickly pick up the concept of it, but it's also challenging because when it comes to ensuring a coherent design\
and user-friendly interface,it could be hard to be creative with it and also hard to make sure that it displays the same across various devices. \
\
