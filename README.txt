- Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
Overall, this assignment took me 5 hours-ish to finish. The most challenging piece for me was to ensure that the images and links were functioning correctly,especially when re-organizing the file and folder structure. And I think working with HTML and CSS might be considered both easy and challenging - easy because of its simple syntax, and beginners like me could quickly pick up the concept of it, but it's also challenging because when it comes to ensuring a coherent design and user-friendly interface,it could be hard to be creative with it and also hard to make sure that it displays the same across various devices. 

- What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
Implementing a responsive design using media queries to ensure usability and legibility on smaller screens.
Ensuring all navigation elements are easily clickable and properly spaced on a smaller viewport.
Simplifying layouts for mobile views to prioritize essential information and usability.

- What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that you particularly proud of?
I reference the clean and simple design from:https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/YzPJKoP. I'm proud of my clean presentation of the website. I hope my design can focus on a clear, intuitive navigation structure, ensuring that the information is easy to locate and emphasizes that professional style.

- Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
If have more time, I might add a form within the "Contact Me" section to directly receive messages without requiring the user to open their email client.
